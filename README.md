To easily compile, set the project to build for Release in x86. The project is set to target the required libraries that are included in the repo.

**Controls**

Z - Turn on/off showing a wireframe for the polygons in the terrain.

X - Turn on/off showing the normals for the polygon faces.

C - Turn on/off shading the terrain with light.
